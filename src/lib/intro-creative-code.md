How can you _draw_ sound? This is a question I've been exploring since realizing that I can see sound because of a condition called Synesthesia. I know what sound tastes, feels, and looks like. I started drawing these sounds, but the more intricate the colours and shapes became, the more difficult it was to accurately draw them. I tried using design software I knew, but it wasn't enough. I looked into open-source software and found interesting art generators, but I didn't want something else to change my drawings. I wanted to do it myself. That's why I started using creative coding. Finally, I found a tool that I can use to start to re-create shapes that are similar to what I see.

I started with concentrating on shapes and dynamic movement of lines before I move into using colour in generative art. why? because expanse level of hue on the colour wheel in my head is too complex to pin point specific hue.
